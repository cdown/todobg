Warning: jank ahead. Definitely doesn't work portably, especially with multi
monitor setups.

This is a small script to display a daily todo list on the root X window. The
idea is that you hook up `todobg --recreate` to a timer at (say) midnight, and
tick things off with `$EDITOR .cache/todobg` as you get the chance. Compared to
a phone app, this works pretty well for me since it's in my face.

Requires imagemagick, inotify-tools, xrandr, awk, and maybe some other stuff.
